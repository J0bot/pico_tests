# pico_tests
I'm trying to program my raspberry pi pico with c/c++, a real pain



To compile this, go to the pico_tests folder execute those commands:
  ```
  $ mkdir build
  $ cd build
  $ cmake ..
  $ make
  ```
  
prior to that, you have to clone the [pico-sdk repo](https://github.com/raspberrypi/pico-sdk) and added it to the PICO_SDK_PATH in the end of your ~/.bashrc

I will make a script to install all of this at once without living the same pain as I did.
